          As a passionate front-end developer, I create amazing websites and web
          apps to make the internet a better place. I am an advocate for web
          performance and accessibility as well as a JAMstack enthusiast with
          experience in serverless technologies.

          I am &radic;1,024 years old and have been a web developer for as long
          as I can think. The technologies I work with are JavaScript, HTML and
          CSS with a focus on the frameworks React.js, Gatsby, Next.js, Node and
          Express. I use code not only to do my day-to-day job, but also to
          solve everyday problems I come across.
        </p>
        <p className="text-white">
          When I am not writing code I love to spend time with my wife and
          five-year-old daughter at home in England or travelling around the
          world. We are quite a multi-cultural family with me having grown up in
          Germany ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª and my wife being from Mexico ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½, which is why we raise our
          daughter trilingual. I myself speak five languages (some better than
          others). Furthermore I enjoy cooking fresh food when I come home after
          a long day at the office.
